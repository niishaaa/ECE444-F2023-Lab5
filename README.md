## What are the pros and cons of TDD?
Given below are the pros and cons of TDD.

#### Pros:  
1. Ensures that there is no unwanted or unrequired code.
2. TDD produces higher-quality code i.e. fewer defects and better quality.
3. This methodology ensures modular code.
4. Ensures that there is overall higher productivity in the team.

#### Cons:  
1. It can be a challenge to maintain code as both files (app and test) need to be updated in case of any changes.
2. The TDD development structure may not be suitable for all types of projects.
3. It is not suitable for fast-paced projects as it takes an extensive amount of time.
